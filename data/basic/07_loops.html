<h1>Loops</h1>

<hr>

<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>
<p>A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</p>
<!--  The following diagram illustrates a loop statement &#x2212;</p>

<p>Python programming language provides following types of loops to handle looping requirements.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:30%">Loop Type</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_while_loop.htm" title="WHILE loop in Python">while loop</a> -->
while loop
</p></td>
<td>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_for_loop.htm" title="FOR loop in Python">for loop</a> -->
for loop
</p></td>
<td>Executes a sequence of statements multiple times and abbreviates the code that manages the loop variable.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_nested_loops.htm" title="nested loops in Python">nested loops</a> -->
nested loops
</p></td><td>You can use one or more loop inside any another while, for or do..while loop.</td></tr>

<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tr><th style="width:30%">Control Statement</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_break_statement.htm" title="break statement in Python">break statement</a> -->
break statement
</p></td>
<td>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_continue_statement.htm" title="continue statement in Python">continue statement</a> -->
continue statement
</p></td>
<td>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</td></tr>
<tr><td><p>
<!-- <a href="/python/python_pass_statement.htm" title="pass statement in Python">pass statement</a>
 -->pass statement
</p></td>
<td>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</td></tr>
