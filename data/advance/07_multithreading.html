<h1>Python Multithreaded Programming</h1>

<hr>

<p>Running several threads is similar to running several different programs concurrently, but with the following benefits &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>Multiple threads within a process share the same data space with the main thread and can therefore share information or communicate with each other more easily than if they were separate processes.</p></li>
<li><p>Threads sometimes called light-weight processes and they do not require much memory overhead; they care cheaper than processes.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<p>A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion. It has an instruction pointer that keeps track of where within its context it is currently running.</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>It can be pre-empted (interrupted)</p></li>
<li><p>It can temporarily be put on hold (also known as sleeping) while other threads are running - this is called yielding.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<h2>Starting a New Thread</h2>
<p>To spawn another thread, you need to call following method available in <i>thread</i> module:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )
</pre>
<p>This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.</p>
<p>The method call returns immediately and the child thread starts and calls function with the passed list of <i>args</i>. When function returns, the thread terminates.</p>
<p>Here, <i>args</i> is a tuple of arguments; use an empty tuple to call function without passing any arguments. <i>kwargs </i>is an optional dictionary of keyword arguments.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python

import thread
import time

# Define a function for the thread
def print_time( threadName, delay):
   count = 0
   while count &lt; 5:
      time.sleep(delay)
      count += 1
      print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % ( threadName, time.ctime(time.time()) )

# Create two threads as follows
try:
   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (&quot;Thread-1&quot;, 2, ) )
   thread.start_new_thread( print_time, (&quot;Thread-2&quot;, 4, ) )
except:
   print &quot;Error: unable to start thread&quot;

while 1:
   pass

<p>Although it is very effective for low-level threading, but the <i>thread</i> module is very limited compared to the newer threading module.</p>
<h2>The <i>Threading</i> Module:</h2>
<p>The newer threading module included with Python 2.4 provides much more powerful, high-level support for threads than the thread module discussed in the previous section.</p>
<p>The <i>threading</i> module exposes all the methods of the <i>thread</i> module and provides some additional methods:</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p><b>threading.activeCount():</b> Returns the number of thread objects that are active.</p></li>
<li><p><b>threading.currentThread():</b> Returns the number of thread objects in the caller&apos;s thread control.</p></li>
<li><p><b>threading.enumerate():</b> Returns a list of all thread objects that are currently active.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<p>In addition to the methods, the threading module has the <i>Thread</i> class that implements threading. The methods provided by the <i>Thread</i> class are as follows:</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p><b>run():</b> The run() method is the entry point for a thread.</p></li>
<li><p><b>start():</b> The start() method starts a thread by calling the run method.</p></li>
<li><p><b> join([time]):</b> The join() waits for threads to terminate.</p></li>
<li><p><b> isAlive():</b> The isAlive() method checks whether a thread is still executing.</p></li>
<li><p><b> getName():</b> The getName() method returns the name of a thread.</p></li>
<li><p><b> setName():</b> The setName() method sets the name of a thread.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<h2>Creating Thread Using <i>Threading</i> Module</h2>
<p>To implement a new thread using the threading module, you have to do the following &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p>Define a new subclass of the <i>Thread</i> class.</p></li>
<li><p>Override the <i>__init__(self [,args])</i> method to add additional arguments.</p></li>
<li><p>Then, override the run(self [,args]) method to implement what the thread should do when started.</p></li>
</ion-list>
<p>Once you have created the new <i>Thread</i> subclass, you can create an instance of it and then start a new thread by invoking the <i>start()</i>, which in turn calls <i>run()</i> method.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python

import threading
import time

exitFlag = 0

class myThread (threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):
        threading.Thread.__init__(self)
        self.threadID = threadID
        self.name = name
        self.counter = counter
    def run(self):
        print &quot;Starting &quot; + self.name
        print_time(self.name, self.counter, 5)
        print &quot;Exiting &quot; + self.name

def print_time(threadName, delay, counter):
    while counter:
        if exitFlag:
            threadName.exit()
        time.sleep(delay)
        print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))
        counter -= 1

# Create new threads
thread1 = myThread(1, &quot;Thread-1&quot;, 1)
thread2 = myThread(2, &quot;Thread-2&quot;, 2)

# Start new Threads
thread1.start()
thread2.start()

<h2>Synchronizing Threads</h2>
<p>The threading module provided with Python includes a simple-to-implement locking mechanism that allows you to synchronize threads. A new lock is created by calling the <i>Lock()</i> method, which returns the new lock.</p>
<p>The <i>acquire(blocking)</i> method of the new lock object is used to force threads to run synchronously. The optional <i>blocking</i> parameter enables you to control whether the thread waits to acquire the lock.</p>
<p>If <i>blocking</i> is set to 0, the thread returns immediately with a 0 value if the lock cannot be acquired and with a 1 if the lock was acquired. If blocking is set to 1, the thread blocks and wait for the lock to be released.</p>
<p>The <i>release()</i> method of the new lock object is used to release the lock when it is no longer required.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<pre class="prettyprint notranslate">
#!/usr/bin/python

import threading
import time

class myThread (threading.Thread):
    def __init__(self, threadID, name, counter):

        # Free lock to release next thread
        threadLock.release()

def print_time(threadName, delay, counter):
    while counter:
        time.sleep(delay)
        print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (threadName, time.ctime(time.time()))

<h2>Multithreaded Priority Queue</h2>
<p>The <i>Queue</i> module allows you to create a new queue object that can hold a specific number of items. There are following methods to control the Queue &#x2212;</p>
<ion-list>
<li><p><b>get():</b> The get() removes and returns an item from the queue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>put():</b> The put adds item to a queue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>qsize() :</b> The qsize() returns the number of items that are currently in the queue.</p></li>
<li><p><b>empty():</b> The empty( ) returns True if queue is empty; otherwise, False.</p></li>
<li><p><b>full():</b> the full() returns True if queue is full; otherwise, False.</p></li>
